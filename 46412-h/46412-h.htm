<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>Cyril Torneur is known only as an author, none of
the dramatic biographers giving any account of him.
Winstanley quotes the following distich from a contemporary
poet, by which it appears that he was not held
in much estimation for his writings&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His fame unto that pitch was only rais'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As not to be despis'd, nor over-prais'd."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He was the author of&mdash;</p>

<p>[(1.) The Transformed Metamorphosis, a Poem. 8<sup>o</sup>,
London, 1600.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>]</p>

<p>(2.) The Revengers Trag&oelig;die. As it hath beene sundry
times Acted by the Kings Maiesties Seruants. At
London. Printed by G. Eld, and are to be sold at his
house in Fleete-lane at the signe of the Printers-Presse.
1607, 4<sup>o</sup>. Again (a new date only) 1608, 4<sup>o</sup>.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>(3.) "The Atheists Tragedie: Or The honest Mans
Reuenge. As in diuers places it hath often beene Acted.
Written by Cyril Tourneur. At London Printed for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>John Stepneth and Richard Redmer, and are to be
sold at their shop, at the West end of Paules. 1611,"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
4<sup>o</sup>. Again, 1612, 4<sup>o</sup>.</p>

<p>(4.) A Traji-Comedy, called The Nobleman, never
printed, and which Oldys says was destroyed by ignorance.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>(5.) A Funerall Poeme. Vpon the Death of the most
Worthie and Trve Sovldier: Sir Francis Vere, Knight,
Captaine of Portsmouth, L. Gouernour of his Maiesties
Cautionarie Towne of Briell in Holland, &amp;c., 4<sup>o</sup>, 1609.</p>

<p>(6.) A Griefe on the Death of Prince Henrie. Expressed
in a broken Elegie, according to the nature of
such a sorrow, 4<sup>o</sup>, 1613.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>[A MS. note in one of the former editions says:
"This is a most splendid work. The character of <i>Vendice</i>
surpasses anything else of the kind. The power
with which it is conceived and conducted is appalling.
The quaint way that accompanies it adds to its fearful
effect. The whole is perfectly tremendous."]</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> [See Hazlitt's "Handbook," 1867, <i>art.</i> Tourneur, in Appendix.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> "The Revenger's Tragedy" was entered on the Stationers'
Books, with "A Trick to Catch the Old One," on
the 7th October 1607.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> There are some good passages in this play, but upon the
whole it is considerably inferior to "The Revenger's Tragedy."
The plot is unnatural, and the manner in which
the catastrophe is brought about ludicrous.&mdash;<i>Collier</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> It is very probable that Tourneur was concerned in other
dramatic productions, which are either anonymous, or have
been lost. He is mentioned in the following terms by Robert
Daborne in a letter to P. Henslowe, dated 5th June 1613:
"I have not only laboured my own play, which shall be
ready before they (the company) come over, but given Cyrill
Tourneur an act of the 'Arraignment of London' to write,
y<sup>t</sup> we may have that likewise ready for them."&mdash;<i>Collier</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> [This is part of a volume entitled, "Three Elegies on
the most Lamented Death of Prince Henrie," 1613. The
others are by John Webster and T. Heywood.] After the
title comes a prose dedication, "To my noble Maister
George Carie," and four lines "To the Reader." At the
end of the "Griefe" are verses "On the representation of
the Prince at his funeralle," and "On the succession," each
in eight lines.&mdash;<i>Gilchrist</i>.</p></div></div>

<p>
Duns Scotus was an English Franciscan Friar who,
differing from Thomas Aquinas, occasioned a famous scholastic
division, known by the titles of Thomists and Scotists.
He died at Paris in 1308. Erasmus, who had a very low
opinion of this writer, in his "Praise of Folie," 1549, sig.
N 3, says: "Lykewise not longe agone I was present at the
sermon of an other famous doctour being almost 80 yeres
old, and thereto so doctour lyke, as if <i>Duns</i> were new
arisen in him, who entending to disclose the mistery of the

act iv. sc. 5, which many modern editors have altered to
the more modern phrase of <i>in private</i>; but as Dr Johnson
observes, "if phraseology is to be changed as words grow
uncouth by disuse, or gross by vulgarity, the history of every
language will be lost; we shall no longer have the words of
any author; and as these alterations will often be unskilfully
made, we shall in time have very little of his meaning."
Mr Steevens, by several instances, has shown that the terms
were in common use, and conveyed no low or vulgar ideas,
and several others might be added: as in Ascham's "Toxophilus,"
1571: "If shootinge fault at anye time, it hydes
it not, it lurkes not in corners and <i>budder mother</i>."</p></div>

<h3>[MR COLLIER'S PREFACE.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>]</h3>

<p>Lewes Machin was assisted, as he states, in writing
this play, by one "whose worth hath been often
approved," and it is singular that until very recently
the name of his coadjutor should have remained unknown,
when in the Garrick Collection, always accessible
in the British Museum, is a copy of "The Dumb
Knight," edition of 1608, with the name of his "partner
in the wrong" on the title-page, viz., Jervis or Gervase
Markham. Another copy, with the same distinction,
was sold in Mr Rhodes' collection. Why it was afterwards
altered cannot now be ascertained; perhaps
Markham wished to avoid the consequences of the
"strange constructions" on the play to which Machin
in his epistle refers, and therefore withdrew his name.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>Nevertheless the address of Machin "to the understanding
reader" is prefixed to the copies with and
without the name of his assistant.</p>

<p>Although Markham was a voluminous writer, little
or nothing is known regarding the events of his life.
A curious anecdote of a Gervase Markham is quoted by
Sir E. Brydges, in his edition of Phillips's "Theatrum
Poetarum," p. 279; but in all probability it is not the
same individual, as that person was high sheriff of
Nottinghamshire in 1625, and was robbed of &pound;5000.
Gervase Markham the poet and book-maker never could
have possessed any such sum. He is said to have been
the son of Robert Markham of Cotham; but this is very
questionable. When and where he was born, and died,
yet remains to be discovered. He began his career of
authorship late in the reign of Elizabeth, viz., in 159[3,
when his "Thyrsis and Daphne," a piece no longer
known, was revised for the press. In the same year he
produced "A Discourse of Horsemanship;" and] in
1595 he published "The Most Honourable Tragedie of
Sir Richard Grinvile (Grenville), Knight." By this
work he seems to have acquired much reputation.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
Though called a <i>tragedy</i>, it is only a narrative and
elegiac poem in the octave rhyme.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>
<p>Ritson also assigns to Markham a translation of
Solomon's Song, in the same year, but it has only the
initials L.M. on the title-page. In 1597, he printed a
translation from the French, called "Devoreux, Vertues
Tears for the Loss of the Most Christian King Henry
III." In 1608 appeared a translation of Ariosto's
"Satires," with his name on the title-page, but the
work was subsequently claimed by Robert Tofte. The
blame belonged, perhaps, to some knavish bookseller
who, having obtained the MS., availed himself of
Markham's popularity. [Barnaby Rich's "Alarm to
England," was reprinted in 1625 under the title of
"Vox Militis," with a poem by Markham prefixed, and
without any mention of the true writer.] He continued
to write various works, some on agriculture and farriery,
[during the reign of James I.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>] His only other dramatic
performance was a tragedy called "Herod and Antipater,"
which was printed in 1622, and in the composition
of which he was joined by W. Sampson.</p>

<p>Of Lewis Machin merely the name has come down
to us in connection with Markham and William
Barkstead. The latter in 1607 printed "Mirrha, the
Mother of Adonis," and at the end of it were placed
"three Eglogs" by Lewis Machin. The first of
"Menalcas and Daphnis," and the two others of "Apollo
and Hyacinth." It is impossible now to ascertain what
share he had in "The Dumb Knight," which appears to
have been a successful play, although its merits are by
no means conspicuous. It is mentioned in the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>terms in Shirley's "Example," 1637, sig. A 4:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>"The Dumb Knight" was entered on the stationers'
books on the 6th October 1608, in which year it was
first printed. It was reprinted in 1633, perhaps on its
revival at one of the theatres, which led Shirley to
allude to it in 1637. The edition of 1633 is a copy of
that of 1608, with all the original errors, and the addition
of some others. It sometimes happens that an
obscure reading is explained or a misprint corrected in
later copies, even if the mistakes generally are multiplied;
but this is not the case with "The Dumb
Knight." Mr Reed seems to have used the edition of
1633, and therefore included most of the errors of both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>of the old copies. He also introduced several conjectural
alterations of his own, and in a manner not
easily justified, since he gave no intimation of the
liberty he had taken with the author. The play has
now been carefully collated, and the more important
variations pointed out in the notes.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

Dumb Knight, which then could not answer for
himself; but now this publication doth untie his
tongue, to answer the objections of all sharp critical
censures, which here-to-fore have undeservedly
passed upon him. And for my part, I protest the
wrongs I have received by some (whose worths I
will not traduce), with a mild neglect I have
laughed at their follies; for I think myself happy,
because I have been envied, since the best now in
grace have been subject to some slanderous tongues
that want worth themselves, and think it great
praise to them to detract praise from others that
deserve it; yet having a partner in the wrong,
whose worth hath been often approved, I count
the wrong but half a wrong, because he knows
best how to answer for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> himself; but I now in his
absence make this apology, both for him and me.
Thus leaving you and the book together, I ever
rest yours,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> Why how now, Mistress Prate? i' th' old
disease still? will it never be better? cannot a
woman find one kind man amongst twenty? O
the days that I have seen, when the law of a
woman's wit could have put her husband's purse
to execution!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lol.</span> O Mistress Collaquintida, mine is even
the unnaturallest man to his wife&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> Faith, for the most part, all scholars are
so, for they take so upon them to know all things,
that indeed they know nothing; and besides,
they are with study and ease grown so unwieldy,
that a woman shall ne'er want a sore stomach
that's troubled with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lol.</span> And yet they must have the government of all.</p>

what! she'll save what he spends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> By the standard, I assure you: you have a

of my life, I have forgot myself; if my husband
should rise from his study, and miss me, we
should have such a coil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> A coil, why what coil? if he were my
husband, and did but thwart me, I would ring
him so many alarums, sound him so many brass
trumpets, beat him so many drums to his confusion,
and thunder him such a peal of great-shot, that I
would turn his brain in the pan, and make him
mad with an eternal silence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lol.</span> O Mistress Collaquintida, but my husband's
anger is the worst-favouredst, without all
conscience, of any man's in all Sicily; he is even
as peevish as a sick monkey, and as waspish as
an ill-pleas'd bride the second morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> Let your wrath be reciprocal, and pay
him at his own weapon&mdash;but to the purpose for
which I came. The party you wot of commends
him to you in this diamond; he that met the
party you know, and said the party's party was a
party of a partly pretty understanding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lol.</span> O, the Lord Alphonso.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> The very same, believe it: he loves you,
and swears he so loves you, that if you do not
credit him, you are worse than an infidel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lol.</span> Indeed, Mistress Collaquintida, he hath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>the right garb for apparel, the true touch with the
tongue in the kiss, and he dances well but falls
heavily: but my husband, woman, my husband!&mdash;if
we could put out his cat's eyes, there were something
to be said; but they are ever peeping and
prying, that they are able to pierce through a
millstone: besides, I may say to you, he is a little
jealous too; and see where he comes! We shall
have a coil now.</p></div>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>[This play is anonymous, although some of our earlier
antiquaries, such as Coxeter and Oldys, have attribu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>ted
it to this or that author without the slightest authority.
It was originally licensed by Sir George Buc to Joseph
Hunt and Thomas Archer on the 22d October 1607.
As neither of these stationers'<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> names is to the first
edition, there was probably a transfer, or possibly an
earlier impression than any now known. This drama
was suggested by, rather than founded on, the traditional
account handed down in print of Peter Fabel,
popularly known as the "Merry Devil of Edmonton."
In 1631 Thomas Brewer published a prose tract on the
same subject.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> "The Merry Devil of Edmonton" had
been acted before 1608], being mentioned in the
"Blacke Booke" by T.M., 1604. "Give him leave to
see 'The Merry Devil of Edmunton, or A Woman
kill'd with Kindness;'" and that it was a favourite
performance, may be concluded from the following
lines in Ben Jonson's Prologue to "The Devil is an
Ass"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">"If you'll come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see new plays, pray you afford us room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And show this but the game face you have done<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Your dear delight</i>, <span class="smcap">The Devil of Edmonton</span>. "<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A MS. note in Sir W. Tite's catalogue may be copied
here with advantage:&mdash;"This is a dear little drama
In manner it is broad and real; in situation, full of
interest. The action, which is very bustling, is propelled
merrily on by characters which are varied
without end, and touched, the most inconsiderable of
them, by strong individuality. <i>It has been ascribed to</i>
<i>Shakespeare, and it reminds one constantly of the Merry</i>
<i>Wives: it is decidedly in his manner, and though there</i>
<i>is nothing that shows his greatest strength, there is certainly</i>
<i>nothing unworthy of him.</i> We read it with
gratification, and we rise from it with feelings of kindness
towards human nature. How delightful, after the
filth and atrocity which form the groundwork of so
many contemporary publications!"</p>

<p>Hazlitt also speaks very highly of this play,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> which
he describes as "perhaps the first example of sentimental
comedy we have." He adds: "'The Merry
Devil of Edmonton,' which has been sometimes attributed
to Shakespeare, is assuredly not unworthy of
him. It is more likely, however, both from the style
and subject-matter, to have been Heywood's than any
other person's.... Romantic, sweet, tender, it expresses
the feelings of honour, of love, and friendship in their
utmost delicacy, enthusiasm, and purity."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_233_233" id="Footnote_233_233"></a><a href="#FNanchor_233_233"><span class="label">[233]</span></a> It went through various editions (the titles of which
are inserted above) in 1608, [1612], 1617, 1626, 1631, and
1655. The first of these is the most rare, and was not long
since sold by auction for eight guineas. Mr Reed states
that, the last edition of 1655 is "unworthy of any notice
from the number of errors it contains;" but these errors
are chiefly literal, and some corrections of considerable
importance are made in it, of which Mr Reed availed himself
without acknowledgment.

It seems to have been revived before 1692, but at what
precise date is not known. The following cast of parts is
written on the back of a copy of the edition of 1655, in the
Garrick Collection, in a hand no doubt of the time when it

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>Lodowick Barry is said to have been a gentleman of
Irish birth, and Anthony Wood is pleased to compliment
him with the title of Lord, which is very probably
a mistake. No circumstances concerning him remain,
not even the times of his birth and death; though the
latter was not unlikely to be soon after the publication
of the following play, the only one which he wrote.
The writer of his article in the "Biographia Dramatica"
says that "the plot in this play of William Small-shanks
decoying the Widow Taffata into marriage is
the same with that in Kiligrew's 'Parson's Wedding,'
<i>and both taken from the 'English Rogue.</i>'" The latter
part of this assertion is entirely without foundation,
and the least attention to dates would have prevented
the writer's falling into so gross an error. Both plays
were published before "The English Rogue" appeared;
"Ram-Alley"<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> above fifty years; and "The Parson's
Wedding" about ten or twelve.</p>

poor member of the Law), by telling me my fortune, whether
I shall die in my bed or no, or what else shall happen to

"That all the ladies and gallants lye languishing <i>upon the</i>

&amp;c.
</p>
<p>
And in Dekker's "Bel-man of London," sig. B 4: "The

with greene boughes, and the <i>floore strewed with bulrushes</i>,
as if some lasse were that morning to be married."

"Ram-Alley," the first in 1611, and the other in 1636; the
latter printed from the former with a number of additional
errors. From the more corrupt of the two copies this play
has been, hitherto reprinted, without any comparison of
the two; they have now for the first time been accurately
collated, and in many instances the correct reading has
been restored.&mdash;<i>Collier.</i>         [A few trifling corrections were
introduced by Mr Collier, but the most serious corruptions

<p>
"Ram-Alley" may be characterised as a strongly-written
and well-constructed domestic drama, valuable as a social
monument of the times, and interesting as the author's only
known production. But it is full of gross passages, allusions,
and innuendoes. In "The Return from Parnassus,"
1606 (ix. 117), occurs the phrase "Ram-Alley meditations,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>the saying having become proverbial, perhaps, for
ruffianly language, as the locality was, no doubt, notorious

not usually applied. The Rev. Mr Todd, in his edition of
Dr Johnson's Dictionary, says, "Bishop Hall has rendered
Virgil's <i>arma</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>battles</i>, by the word <i>garboil</i>."
This is a mistake, for Hall is laughing at Stanihurst for
having so done in his attempted <i>hexameter</i> translation of
the &AElig;neid&mdash;

</div></div>
<p>
&mdash;B. i. sat. 6.
</p>
<p>
But there are many authorities besides Shakespeare, in
his "Antony and Cleopatra," for its employment. Gascoigne
inserts it in the speech of Hercules in the "Princely
Pleasures of Kenilworth": "A <i>garboyel</i> this in deede,"
["Works" by Hazlitt, ii. 93]. Drayton also uses it in [his
"Mortimeriados," 1596,] quoted in "England's Parnassus,"
p. 444&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Such is the <i>garboyle</i> of this conflict then;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brave Englishmen encountering Englishmen."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
and T. Heywood, in his "Rape of Lucrece," 1608, talks of
"the head of all these garboyles, the chief actor of that
black sin," &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Collier.</i></p></div>

"Life of Bishop Seth Ward," 1697, p. 104, is the following
passage: "My Lord, I <i>might bear you in hand</i>; a western
phrase, signifying <i>to delay or keep in expectation</i>, and feed you
with promises, or at least hopes, that I should cure you in
some competent time," &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
Again, in Fennor's "Compter's Commonwealth," p. 47:
"I have seen divers gentlemen come into prison (after they
have laine a fortnight or three weekes at some of their
houses, at an excessive rate) without either cloake, sword,
or hat, which the sergeants have got from them, onely
<i>bearing them in hand</i> that they will get them baile."

<p>
Dr Grey, in his "Notes on Shakespeare," i. 284, has
given the ceremonial on pronouncing an excommunication,
by which it appears that in the performance of this
office three candles were to be extinguished in the different
parts of it. In Archbishop Winchelsea's sentences of excommunication,
anno 1298 (see Johnson's "Ecclesiastical
Laws," vol. ii.), it is directed that the sentence against
infringers of certain articles should be "throughout explained
<i>in order in English</i>, with <i>bells tolling and candles</i>
<i>lighted</i>, that it may cause the greater dread; for Laymen
have greater regard to this solemnity than to the effect of
such sentences."</p></div>

Hawkins, in his "History of Music," iv. 391) "frequent
mention is made by our old dramatic writers. Thus, in the
'Island Princess' of Beaumont and Fletcher, act v., one of
the Townsmen says&mdash;

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'All the windows of the town dance a new <i>trenchmore.</i>'<br /></span>

<p>
In the 'Table Talk' of Selden, title <i>King of England</i>, is the
following humorous passage:&mdash;'The Court of England is
much altered. At a solemn dancing, first, you had the
grave measures, then the corantoes and the galliards, and
this is kept up with ceremony; at length to <i>trenchmore</i> and
the cushion-dance: and then all the company dance, lord
and groom, lady and kitchen-maid, no distinction. So in
our Court ... in King Charles's time, there has been
nothing but <i>trenchmore</i> and the cushion-dance, omnium
gatherum, tolly polly, hoite cum toite.' And in the comedy
of 'The Rehearsal,' the earth, sun, and moon are made to
dance the hey to the tune of <i>trenchmore</i>. From all which
it may be inferred that the <i>trenchmore</i> was a lively movement."
</p>
<p>
The <i>trenchmore</i> is also mentioned in Beaumont and
Fletcher's "Pilgrim," act iv. sc. 3.</p></div>

Abraham Fleming, in his tract "Of Englishe Dogges, the
diversities, the names, the natures, and the properties," 1576,
speaks of the introduction of <i>Iceland dogs</i>, and describes
them. "Use and custome hath intertained other dogges of
an outlandish kinde, but a few, and the same being of a
pretty bygnesse, I meane <i>Iseland dogges</i>, curled and rough
al over, which by reason of the length of their heare, make
showe neither of face nor of body. And yet these curres,
forsoothe, because they are so straunge, are greatly set by,
esteemed, taken vp, and made of, many times in the roome
of the Spaniell, gentle or comforter."&mdash;<i>Collier.</i> [Sig. F 4.

"De Canibus Britannicis."]</p></div>

Mr Tyrwhitt says, the character is to be met with in an

appear from this passage to signify different kinds of
vehicles, or different sizes of the same. About this time
they were come into general use. Dr Percy, in his Notes
to the "Northumberland Household Book," p. 448, says,
from Anderson's "Origin of Commerce," that coaches were
introduced into England by Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, A.D.
1580; but from the following passage in the works of Taylor
the Water-Poet, 1630, p. 240, they appear to have been used
some years earlier:&mdash;"For in the yeere 1564, one William
Boonen, a Dutchman, brought first the use of coaches hither,
and the said Boonen was Queene Elizabeth's coachman; for
indeede a coach was a strange monster in those days, and
the sight of them put both horse and man into amazement:
some said it was a great crabshell brought out of China, and
some imagin'd it to be one of the pagan temples, in which
the cannibals adored the divell: but at last those doubts
were cleared, and coach-making became a substantial trade:
so that now all the world may see they are as common as
whores, and may be hired as easie as knights of the post."
Dr Percy observes, they were first drawn with two horses,
and that it was the favourite Buckingham who, about 1619,
began to draw with six horses which, Wilson tells us ("Life
of King James," 1653, fol. p. 130), "was wondered at then
as a novelty, and imputed to him as a mastering pride."
About the same time, he introduced sedan chairs.</p></div>

used to earn a scanty pittance by going about in winter
evenings to taverns and inns, playing for the entertainment
of the company they found there. Sir John Hawkins
("History of Music," v. 66) mentions a person who was an
excellent performer, and yet submitted to get his living by
this practice so late as the year 1735. It is said that some
musicians attended the greater inns so constantly that they
might in some sort be styled retainers to the houses.
A very curious and rare tract, with the title of "The
Actors Remonstrance or Complaint for the Silencing of their
Profession," 1643, has the following apposite passage:&mdash;"Our
Musike that was held so delectable and precious that
they scorned to come to a Taverne under twenty shillings
salary for two houres, now wander with their Instruments
under their cloaks, I meane such as haue any, into all houses
of good fellowship, saluting every roome where there is
company with <i>Will you have any musike, Gentlemen?</i>" Such
was one consequence of the severity of Puritan discipline.&mdash;<i>Collier.</i>

house or abroad, <i>a thing made of wood, and covered with</i>

that it is pitty this foolish custom is not cleane banished

maketh many of their women that are very short seeme
much taller than the tallest women we have in England.
Also I have heard that this is observed among them, that
by how much the nobler a women is, by so much the higher
are her chapineys. All their gentlewomen, and most of
their wives and widowes that are of any wealth, are assisted
and supported eyther by men or women when they walke

<h2>THE SECOND MAIDEN'S TRAGEDY.</h2>


<h3>PREFACE TO THE FORMER EDITION<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>.</h3>

<p>This is one of the MSS. plays which escaped the
fatal hands of Warburton's cook, and is printed from a
manuscript book of that gentleman in the Lansdowne
Collection. No title page is prefixed to the manuscript,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>nor is the name of "The Second Maiden's Tragedy" in
the same handwriting as the play. From the tenor of
the licence to act, indeed, it is probable that this name
was given to it by the Master of the Revels; that
licence is in the following words: "This Second
Maiden's Tragedy (for it hath no name inscribed) may,
with the reformations, bee acted publickly. 31 October,
1611, G. Buc." Why it is called "The Second Maiden's
Tragedy" does not appear; there is no trace of any
drama having the title of "The First Maiden's
Tragedy," and it does not bear any resemblance to
the "Maid's Tragedy" of Beaumont and Fletcher.
There is reason therefore to believe that the name, by
which it is now known, was adopted merely for the
purpose of distinguishing it from other plays licensed
to be acted, as the words, "for it hath no name inscribed,"
can hardly be supposed to refer to the want of
the author's name, which is as difficult to be ascertained
as that of his play. At the back of the manuscript,
it is said to be by a person whose name, on a close
inspection, appears to have been William (afterwards
altered to Thomas) Goughe. This name has been
nearly obliterated, and that of "George Chapman" substituted,
which in its turn has been scored through, for
the purpose of making room for "Will. Shakspear."
That it does not belong to Thomas Goff,<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> the author of
the "Raging Turk," is abundantly obvious. He was
at the time it was licensed not more than nineteen
years of age, and besides was totally incapable of producing
anything of the kind; nor has Chapman, in our
opinion, a better title to it. Many of the scenes are
distinguished by a tenderness and pathos which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a><br /><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>not to be found in the productions of either of those
authors; but although it possesses merits of no ordinary
kind, it cannot be pretended that it approaches
the character of the dramas of Shakespeare, whose name
indeed is written in a much more modern hand. The
subordinate plot is founded upon the story of the
<i>Curious Impertinent</i> in "Don Quixote," from which it
differs very little, except in the catastrophe. Various
parts of the play have been struck out, some for the purpose
of being omitted in the representation, and others,
which were probably considered dangerous or offensive
to royalty, apparently by Sir George Buc; for example,
in the second scene of the last act, the exclamation of
the Tyrant, "Your King's poisoned!" is altered to "I
am poisoned;" the <i>propriety</i> of which reformation is
manifest from the answer of Memphonius, viz., "The
King of Heaven be praised for it!" In both cases the
original text has been restored in the present publication.</p>

<h3>[PREFACE TO THE FORMER EDITION.]<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></h3>

<p>This old comedy appears to have been extremely
popular, and it was three times printed; in 1616, 1626,
and 1631; the oldest copy is, as usual, the most correct,
but in the following reprint all three have been collated.</p>

<p>It is ascertained from Henslowe's Diary to have been
the production of a dramatic poet of the name of
William Haughton, who generally wrote in conjunction
with Thomas Dekker, Henry Chettle, John Day, and
others, but in this instance he was alone concerned. It
is entered by Henslowe under the date of February
1597-8, and he calls it (as the performance was no
doubt named when it was then first acted), "A Woman
will have her Will." When it was printed in 1616, it
seems to have been thought that "Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>lishmen for my
Money" would be more attractive, and "A Woman
will have her Will" was sunk into the second title; it
therefore runs thus: "Englishmen for my Money, or
a pleasant comedy called A Woman will have her
Will." [But in the third edition the first part of the
title was withdrawn.]</p>

<p>No biographical particulars of William Haughton are
known, but that in 1599 he was confined in the Clink
in Southwark for debt; and on the 10th March of that
year Henslowe advanced ten shillings to enable him to
obtain his liberty.</p>

<p>This play is full of comic characters and situations,
and the dialogue is generally well sustained. Haughton
was probably young, when he produced it, and
in Henslowe's Diary he is not unfrequently termed
"Young Haughton." His versification was neither
very free nor very flowing, and it partakes in some
degree of the monotony that distinguished most of the
old dramatists who preceded Shakespeare. The old
copies are not divided into acts and scenes.</p>

<span class="i0">Thirty-two ships have I to equal them,<br /></span>

changed its name from the <i>Burse</i>, which it had been previously

is only an abbreviation of <i>topside t'other way</i>, or the upper
end of anything turned downwards&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, bottom upwards.
Archdeacon Nares got as far as <i>top side</i>, but <i>turvy</i>, he

<p><span class="smcap">Fris.</span> O Master Mouse, Master Mouse! it
would make any mouse, rat, cat, or dog laugh, to
think what sport we shall have at our house soon
at night. I'll tell you all: my young mistress sent
me after Master Heigham and his friends to pray
them come to our house, after my old master was
abed. Now I went, and I went; and I run, and
I went; and whom should I meet but my master
Pisaro<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> and the strangers; so my master very
worshipfully (I must needs say) examined me
whither I went. Now, I durst not tell him an
untruth, for fear of lying; but told him plainly
and honestly mine errand. Now, who would think
my master had such a monstrous plaguy wit? he
was as glad as could be; out of all Scotch-and-notch
glad; out of all count glad: and so, sirrah,
he bid the three uplandishmen come in their steads,
and woo my young mistresses. Now it made me
so laugh to think how they would be cozened, that
I could not follow my master. But I'll follow
him: I know he has gone to the tavern in his
merry humour. Now, if you will keep this as
secret as I have done hitherto, we shall have the
bravest sport soon, as can be. I must be gone:
say nothing.      <span class="lineright">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p></div>

Ado about Nothing," and in "The Taming of the Shrew,"
and Malone and Steevens laboured in vain to discover its
applicability. It is also to be met with in H. Chettle's
"Patient Grissel," 1603, where Farnese observes to Julia,
"Then I perceive you mean to <i>lead apes in hell</i>," and she
replies, "That spiteful proverb was proclaimed against them
that are married upon earth, for to be married is to live in
a kind of hell.... Your wife is your ape, and that heavy
burden wedlock, your jack-an-ape's clog: therefore I'll not
be tied to't." This does not throw any new light upon the
matter, nor explain why old maids are destined in the
infernal regions to this duty. If old bachelors were supposed
to be transformed there into apes, it would be very
intelligible.</p></div>

some party has not been treated with sufficient respect.
M is short for Master, and Frisco addresses himself to the
Bellman, who had merely called him Frisco. Thus, in
"Eastward Ho!" act iv. sc. 1, Quicksilver asks, "Must
Golding sit upon us?" To which the constable replies,
"You might carry an M under your girdle."</p></div>

Lilly (for the authorship is disputed) used it as the title
to one of the Mar Martin tracts. Skelton, in his poem,
"Speak Parrot," has the expression, "Parrot must have an
almond." It is met with in Middleton's "Spanish Gipsy,"
act ii. sc. 1; in Ben Jonson's "Magnetic Lady," act v.
sc. 5; in Dekker's "Fortunatus," act i. sc. 1, and various
other plays. The lines from Butler are in point with reference
to the latter part of the line, <i>a rope for parrot</i>.

not speak for laughing. Lord! what a dialogue
hath there been between age and youth. You do
good on her? even as much as my Dutchman will
do on my young mistress. Master, follow my
counsel, then; send for Master Heigham to help
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>him, for I'll lay my cap to twopence that he will
be asleep to-morrow at night, when he should go
to bed to her. Marry, for the Italian, he is of
another humour, for there will be no dealings with
him till midnight; for he must slaver all the
wenches in the house at parting, or he is nobody.
He hath been but a little while at our house, yet
in that small time he hath licked more grease from
our Maudlin's lips than would have served London
kitchenstuff this twelvemonth. Yet, for my money,
well fare the Frenchman! O, he is a forward lad,
for he'll no sooner come from the church but he'll
fly to the chamber; why, he'll read his lesson so
often in the daytime, that at night, like an apt
scholar, he'll be ready to sell his old book to buy
him a new. O, the generations of languages that
our house will bring forth! why, every bed will
have a proper speech to himself, and have the
founder's name written upon it in fair capital letters,
"Here lay," and so forth.                                 <span class="lineright">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

for I'll be hanged if you lose that office, having so
pretty a morsel under your keeping. Ay, go, old
huddle, for the best nose at smelling out a penfold
that I know. Well, take heed, you may 'haps pick
up worms so long, that at length some of them
get into your nose, and never out after. But
what an ass am I to think so, considering all the
lodgings are taken up already, and there's not a
dog-kennel empty for a strange worm to breed in.</p></div>
